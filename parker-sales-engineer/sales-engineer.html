                    <p>Lower scores can be more forgiving with some of the details not being perfect. They

                        be ineffective. If taken to an extreme, their craving for recognition and the need to chase a particular
                        trophy can outweigh the necessity to honor existing systems and teamwork.</p>
                    <p>Lower scores tend to not seek the limelight and are more comfortable promoting team

                        typically required to comfortably step in as an expert. If underdone, the Sales Engineer can fail to speak
