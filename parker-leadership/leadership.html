                    <div class="dimension__definition">
                        <p>This dimension assesses how quickly the candidate can learn and to think on one’s feet. This score is related to the candidate's ability to learn new material quickly, to master product knowledge, to present information well to customers, and to pay attention to client needs. It is a measure of one’s intellectual adaptability and insightfulness. It is typically related to school grades and will show up in other learning achievements.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="dimension__global-statement">
                        <p>This candidate works reasonably well with abstract concepts. However, he may need to continue to improve his skills because there is a correlation between verbal ability and the capacity to learn the business quickly, reason through daily challenges, and solve problems. In addition, managers need to be able to grasp concepts quickly and articulate them to others. If the environment is a highly technical one, determine if his technical skills and problem-solving abilities are adequate. Additional conceptual learning may be particularly helpful in either a formal or informal format.</p>

                        <p>This candidate reports a reasonable balance in his ability to be resourceful and pragmatic. He is able to be imaginative and visionary and, at the same time, attend to the practical necessities of implementing or reinforcing a current circumstance. This balance is typical of solid managers.</p>
                        
                        <p>His critical thinking skills are quite strong, and in most circumstances, he is very open to alternatives and possibilities. In fact, he has a keen eye for observing details or aspects of a situation that appear to be out of place or which may not fit with the rest of the plan. As a result, he has a high drive for change and may become impatient with others if they do not move as quickly to understand a concept or to act on a situation. This high drive will be seen in his sense of urgency.</p>

                        <p>Drive/Influence is related to the ability of the candidate to be self-sufficient after the initial training period. This includes the ability to be bold and persuasive and to independently pursue answers to difficult customer challenges. This dimension is associated with a willingness to do for oneself what the company may find difficult to find time for (i.e. continuous training on product knowledge). Related to this measure is the courage and willingness to assume calculated risks in order to assist the customer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="dimension__global-statement">
                        <p>This candidate indicates a strong desire to be independent. This dimension is important for success in business and management; however, he scores above the typical range. With his strong drive to be in control and promote his ideas, he may override the ideas and desires of others to a point that may actually alienate or offend. He may be able to accomplish a number of tasks and goals through the sheer force of his convictions and perseverance; however, without others being motivated on their own, it can be quite demanding and taxing on the organization. How well he is received as a manager will greatly depend on his level of self- awareness regarding his interpersonal skills, as well as his capacity to monitor and regulate his drive and emotion.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, specific scores make larger contributions or detractions to the management role. In regard to Drive/Influence here are areas to consider:</p>
                                <p class="text-danger">A contributor to his score is his interest in being in control of his circumstances and of generally being in charge. This attribute is positive for most business circumstances where control of the business is ultimately his responsibility. This dimension includes taking active steps to confront others, being assertive, and readily managing situations as they arise.</p>
                                <p class="text-danger">A strong contributor to this score is his high degree of social boldness. This trait assists him in the process of venturing out, creating influence, and getting things done. These traits are positive characteristics as a manager; however, his score is higher than most. His adventurous nature may not be disruptive, providing there are balancing traits that help him stay focused. Otherwise, he may tend to be more interested in the journey itself rather than in completing the matters at hand.</p>

                                <p>Limiting his score is his general orientation to being trusting and accepting of life and individuals. He is comfortable with himself, and he generally takes responsibility for his actions. In many ways, his trust is a positive trait, but at the same time, it is important to be able to realistically anticipate and assess people and situations. It is helpful to be mindful of others’ agendas in a complex business environment, and it is important not to be naïve. His communication style can be very trusting and open, but he will also need to be able to be confrontational in certain situations.</p>

This trait is typical of individuals of a more independent nature, and it will allow him to push his influence into the organization. However, his demand for change may be so high that it could result in being critical of himself or others; circumstances may not be able to keep up with his expectations. This trait may exhibit itself as managerial courage or the willingness to take calculated risks. His willingness to experiment will assist in strategic thinking; he will exhibit a greater tendency to look for alternative solutions and will be more open to different perspectives. However, his impatience may cause him to make changes that are not required or to exhibit poor listening skills.</p>

If this is an accurate self -assessment, it suggests that he is not easily upset. His resilience can be helpful in managing a business. It may also suggest that it is difficult for him to feel motivated to change if he is comfortable and unworried about his circumstances. In this regard, his comfort with himself may limit his ability to be open to suggestions for areas of development. In addition, he may not be interested in moving outside his comfortable zone of confidence. This high score may also indicate a certain degree of emotional stiffness or distance. It is important to know whether he is in touch with his emotions; it is also important for him to understand what is potentially upsetting or of concern to others.</p>

                                <p>He reports a high interest in being adventurous and in initiating contact in a wide variety of social situations. His approach can be helpful, particularly in management roles that require travel and frequent change. However, he is reporting such extreme social boldness that he may not remain satisfied with events for long. He enjoys the spotlight, and he may crave attention. Although meeting and interacting with new people may be part of the fun and adventure of a job, it may also take him away from attending to the routine or procedural areas of the job. The limiting characteristic of this more extreme score will be a tendency to become overly involved and stretched in too many areas at once.</p>

He likes to participate in groups, and he is open to the ideas and preferences of others. He will establish contact with others, and he is interested in being with individuals that are learning around him. This general orientation is positive in management; however, it will be important to see whether this strong desire for cooperation may interfere in situations where the need to stand alone is important. He may not act with urgency to accomplish tasks if he believes doing so will interfere with the cohesiveness of the group. His tendency to put the group and relationships first may interfere with force and determination.</p>

                        <p>This dimension focuses on sensitivity to people and to ideas. It measures the willingness to be open to and to try new approaches to get to the customer. Balance on this dimension suggests responsiveness to how others feel and think while being practical, factual, and business-minded. Intuition can assist the candidate in “reading” the customer and responding appropriately to his or her needs. It is a measure of sensitivity to others.</p>

                        <p>This candidate’s overall score on the Innovation & Change Orientation dimension suggests a more sensitive, receptive, and subjective approach to relating to the world. This style can be helpful in the service/sales side of the business or in any area that calls for more people interaction. However, he may take events and disappointments more to heart and be more prone to internalize conflict and disagreement. You may want to consider how well he works with facts and figures. Additionally, you will need to determine if he has enough practical focus and resilience to address the challenges that are inherent in managing large groups of individuals. For instance, he may hesitate to enter into conflict situations where feelings may get hurt. As such, it will be important for him to learn how to manage conflict in a productive manner. It will also be important for him to not shy away from situations that require pushing for change or dealing with progress.</p>

                                <p>His desire for change diminishes his score. His drive for change is so high that he may push the bounds of reality. He has a high need for progress and development, and his interest in experimenting and moving quickly is high. He may find that colleagues, subordinates, and events do not move as quickly as he thinks they should; therefore, he may be impatient or critical at times. He may also direct these expectations inward and become frustrated with his perceived lack of progress or success. How this style is accepted is related to the culture of the organization. More aggressive and progressive cultures will accept his style more easily than more conservative ones.</p>

                <p>Note where your candidate stands on these characteristics and then consider the suggested follow-up interview questions and accompanying “listen for” statements. Keep in mind that while it is better to be higher than lower on these dimensions, sometimes a candidate can have “too much of a good thing.” Don’t be afraid to supplement the questions provided with some of your own.</p>

Be ready to answer this question: Why is this person a good fit - or not - for the job?</p>
                <p>If you hire this person, be sure to come back to this assessment afterwards to think about what the individual needs to do in order grow professionally and be successful in their role. Use this information as a management tool and as the start of their individual development plan that you put together as their HR representative or manager.</p>
