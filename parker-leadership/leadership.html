                        <p>Drive/Influence is related to the ability of the candidate to exhibit persuasive, assertive, and influential behaviors. This includes the ability to be bold and persuasive and to pursue answers to difficult challenges. Related to this measure is the courage and willingness to assume calculated risks to achieve desired results. There often is a certain amount of vigilance to assure desired objectives. This dimension assesses the drive to challenge others, resolve issues, and move with urgency for change and perceived progress. Many of these behaviors are not a core part of being a professional in a role with no direct reports; however, in certain roles, there is an advantage to have some of them. Determine which behaviors are critical and see how these fit with this score. Also, if this individual is seen as a future candidate for a management/leader role, look to have this score be a little higher than the average here.</p>

                        <p>His lower score on Drive indicates a tendency to be more accommodating to the boundaries of the company or to others, and it suggests that he is generally trusting, accommodating, and conservative in his approach. In team situations, he will often be a good participant, without particular interest in taking a leadership position. In situations that demand a strong stand for his position, his tendency is to be accommodating and agreeable, which can potentially work against him for some of his own interests. As a general style, if he has demonstrated success in the past, he may have relied on his general tendency to be hard working, organized, and precise (see Conscientiousness). He may also be well liked, and people may be quite comfortable with him. However, he may be taken advantage of in some situations. It may be a stretch for him to have influence, and he may have to push himself to initiate change by heightening his sense of urgency and working through organizational obstacles.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, specific scores make larger contributions or detractions to the management role. In regard to Drive here are areas to consider:</p>
                                <p>Modifying his score is his tendency to be accommodating. Managers typically report a higher interest in being in charge and in controlling business circumstances. He may use company processes or a disciplined approach to take control, versus being more personally assertive. This approach may be effective in a structured system; however, in more flexible and fluid business situations, it is important to exercise more personal authority</p>

In many ways, his trust is a positive trait, but at the same time, it is important to be able to realistically anticipate and assess people and situations. It is helpful to be mindful of others’ agendas in a complex business environment, and it is important not to be naïve.

It will be important to see if this tendency is part of his technique for driving himself to achieve. If so, his openness to his own limitations can be healthy, if monitored effectively. A certain amount of self- doubt can help him remain open to development. But, the self-doubt needs to be kept in check so that he is able to move forward with a sense of general acceptance and a self-assured style. As long as his drive does not unduly interfere with the level of confidence and self-assuredness necessary to communicate with and influence others, it can be controlled. It is important, however, to make sure that he has access to the skills to maintain this balance.</p>

It emphasizes how well the person expresses oneself and the willingness and comfort in talking with others. This includes how the candidate would present to an audience, how effectively this person would express support for others’ concerns, and how proficient the person is in listening. Good interpersonal skills positively contribute to collaboration and strong internal and external relationships. For a more technical professional, this may not be as important a characteristic as it would for a manager/leader; thus, the average score is more in the middle.</p>

                        <p>This dimension focuses on sensitivity to people and to ideas. It measures the willingness to be open to and to try new approaches. Balance on this dimension suggests responsiveness to how others feel and think while being practical, factual, and business-minded. Intuition can assist the candidate in “reading” others and responding appropriately to their needs. As with self-control, for the more detailed, task focus of typical professional or technical roles, intuition, creativity, sensitivity to others may well not be an important criterion to high performance. Thus, the target range is a little higher than for managers/leaders which typically is in the middle, more balanced.

Being overly tough can create callousness toward people, their feelings, and his own intuition; all can prove hazardous to his success.</p>

                                <p>A strong contributor to his score is his strong factual orientation. His pragmatism is frequently helpful when operating a technical business; however, he may be indifferent to the opinions and feelings of others and insensitive to his own emotions as well. His relative insensitivity may not allow him to listen and to empathize well with customers and employees. This coolness may detract from the strength of his relationships, thus potentially limiting his management impact.</p>

He follows through on his commitments and does so in a routine and procedural way. Although self-discipline is important, it is also advantageous to have some flexibility so that routines do not restrict his openness to new approaches or ideas. He tends to look for the expectations that are put in front of him and then disciplines himself to meet them. In a technical, highly process-oriented environment, it is important to pay attention to the disciplines and procedures that are in place.

                                <p>A strong contributor to his score is his very focused and practical approach to work. He is almost literal in his view of issues, and he lacks vision, creativity, or imagination in his thinking. Being a manager frequently demands a vision of what lies ahead. This dimension will become apparent in his tendency to adhere to existing paradigms and not be as creative in establishing alternatives. Tactical issues will take precedent over strategic possibilities.</p>

                                <p>A strong contributor to his score is his high interest and concern for detail. He tends to be quite meticulous, almost a perfectionist. His attention to detail can be a positive attribute in a technical world where precision and accuracy are important; however, he may border on being so demanding of details that he is not adequately flexible. In addition, he may get caught up in the details and minutia when it will be important for him to move quickly. As a manager, it is important to attend to key details and, at the same time, be able to look at broader perspectives.</p>

                <p>This report is based on computerized comparisons between individual responses and the professional norm on the Watterson Personality Inventory plus additional ability measures. It is prone to various sources of error and should be interpreted with caution. This report is intended to assist in the interview process, not to substitute for it or for other data. The candidate's scores for each scale are discussed on individual pages.</p>

                <h4 class="instructions__title">BEFORE YOU INTERVIEW</h4>
                <P>This report will tell you how well your candidate fits with the “Big 5” personality characteristics that help predict success in professionals:</P>
                <ul class="instructions__big-five">
                    <li><span>Drive</span></li>
                    <li><span>Stress Tolerance</span></li>
                    <li><span>People Orientation</span></li>
                    <li><span>Practicality</span></li>
                    <li><span>Conscientiousness</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note where your candidate stands on these characteristics and then consider the suggested follow-up interview questions and accompanying “listen for” statements. Keep in mind that while it is better to be higher than lower on these dimensions, sometimes a candidate can have “too much of a good thing.” Don’t be afraid to supplement the questions provided with some of your own.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="instructions__after">
                <h4 class="instructions__title">AFTER YOU INTERVIEW</h4>
                <p>To make a final decision on a candidate, consider what you learned from this report and the follow-up interview, along with other factors like experience, education, references, etc. Match what you have learned to what is important in the job and then make a hiring decision that you can explain in an objective manner. Be ready to answer this question: Why is this person a good fit - or not - for the job?</p>
                <p>If you hire this person, be sure to come back to this assessment afterwards to think about what the individual needs to do in order grow professionally and be successful in their role. Use this information as a management tool and as the start of their individual development plan that you put together as their HR representative or manager.</p>
