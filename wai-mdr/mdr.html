                        <p>As the broad factors of personality related to strong management are considered, a hierarchy emerges. The first and strongest factor in the hierarchy is Drive/Influence—the interest to influence and direct action, to be in control, to exercise one’s skills and abilities to effect a desired outcome. It is important to want control of the processes of your business, but it is equally important to trust others to assist you in the process. An essential aspect that is reflected in this personality dimension is the ability to persuade and to influence others to successfully accomplish the goal. In this aspect, Drive/Influence is the capacity to be appropriately assertive and to exercise authority in a manner that does not demean others. It is the skill of motivating people to fulfill on commitments and to reap benefits from your personal influence, persuasiveness, and guidance in reaching the desired goal.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="dimension__global-statement">
                        <h4 class="text-center">General statements about yourself on this dimension:</h4>
                        <p>Your score on independence indicates that you tend to be more accommodating to the organization’s structure or to others, and it suggests that you are generally trusting, accommodating, and more conservative in your approach. This approach may hinder your ability to perform important actions and behaviors that are typically necessary to run or lead a section of the business. Consider the specific business conditions to see if your pleasant nature has more assets than liabilities. In a business that demands bold conviction in your position, this tendency to be accommodating may work against you and your ability to be profitable. You may be relying on your general tendency to be hard working, organized, and precise. And, although you may be well liked, you may find that people take advantage of you or that your demeanor is not strong enough for the business to thrive.</p>
                        <p>You may hesitate to assume challenging and change-oriented areas of the business. When you meet resistance, you may tend to stop and wait for other factors to move things forward. You may not initiate and force change and advancement to achieve success for you and others. In this regard, it will be beneficial for you to become aware of what interferes with your ability to be more influential and dominant. It will also be helpful to learn how to heighten your sense of urgency and focus on results.</p>
                        <p>Your communications may lack the assertiveness and forcefulness necessary to push through resistance and influence the changes necessary to achieve results. As a manager, you may tend to rely on the systems and procedures that are in place, rather than be directly accountable. Although it is appropriate to be friendly in business circumstances, it is also important to hold others accountable. However, you may find it difficult to hold others accountable or to challenge them because you fear risking the relationship. This dimension will influence your ability to delegate and to achieve results without doing all of the work yourself.
                        </p>

                            <h4 class="text-center">Specific statements about yourself on this dimension:</h4>
                            <p>A contributor to a lower independence score is your tendency to be accommodating. Managers typically report a greater interest in being in charge and in controlling life’s circumstances. You may tend to use systems or a disciplined approach to take control, and you tend not to be personally dominant. This approach may be effective in a structured system; however, in many business and management situations that are more fluid, it is important to exercise more personal authority. Business typically requires a stronger, more dominant individual to achieve positive outcomes. If you are working in a procedural or systematic environment, this trait will not be as critical. Otherwise, it will be helpful to be more assertive and productively confrontational, as well as, more willing to control situations and influence them to positive outcomes.</p>
                            <p>You express an interest in maintaining the status quo and tend to be somewhat more conservative and traditional. Although this style is helpful for maintaining and running current systems, it is not as strong a contributor for leading and venturing into new circumstances that require change and progress. Although you may be attracted to these goals, you prefer taking a more conservative approach. This style is not as typical of managers, and it will be important to see in what way it restricts your interest in assuming this role.</p>
                            <p>Because you tend to be more conservative, you may spend an excessive amount of intellectual energy to get things right—to the point of diminishing returns. Oftentimes, moving forward requires a certain degree of risk that does not quite meet your comfort level.

                                <p>Your more conservative style is a bit different from most managers. Your interest in keeping things stable needs to be balanced against an interest in change and disruption, which are fundamental to progress. As you learn to develop and consider alternatives, you will strengthen your ability to exercise good business acumen and problem-solving skills. Your active learning competency will be enhanced as you learn to push boundaries and experiment with new ideas. You will also take more risks in learning new things, rather than sticking with tried and true solutions. Your perceived sense of urgency will be improved, and your ability to generate positive possibilities will be higher as you learn to experiment more. Your ability to lead with courage will be enhanced, since you are more likely to challenge paradigms and break boundaries.</p>

                        <p>Third in the hierarchy is Interpersonal Style or being oriented toward people and activities that involve others. Since accomplishing a mission through the voluntary contribution of others is much of the success in effective management, it automatically involves contact with people. Relationship skills are fundamental in this regard, and these skills are more effective if you have a natural orientation to being with people. However, Interpersonal Style requires an important balance. That is, although it is important to be oriented towards people, it is equally important to be able to stand on your own in difficult circumstances and not be too dependent on the approval of others in order to have a positive sense of well being.

By applying these skills in appropriate circumstances, you will reach effective outcomes in difficult management situations. Depending on the nature of the business (e.g. scientific, technical, marketing, service, start-up, turn-around) styles can differ because high performance will be more conducive to one style than another. However, in most circumstances, balance is beneficial, with a slight inclination to the tough end of the spectrum, which would allow you to make critical decisions in an authority role.</p>

                        <p>This score is related to an ability to learn new material quickly and to pay attention to the needs of the business and your customers. It is typically related to school grades and will show up in other learning achievements (i.e. GPA, SAT). Individuals who score high on this dimension indicate a superior ability to quickly understand complex subject matter and then use this information to solve problems. Individuals who score low on this ability may exhibit a reduced capacity to learn new material quickly and to apply the knowledge when and where appropriate (i.e. identifying market trends and making the necessary adjustments to remain competitive and successful). They may prefer to think about more grounded or daily matters.</p>

                        <p>You deal reasonably well with abstract concepts; however, it may be helpful to continue to improve your skills. Your verbal ability affects your capacity to learn the business quickly, to reason through daily challenges, and to solve problems. In addition, managers need to be able to grasp concepts quickly and articulate them to others. Additional conceptual learning is particularly helpful and can occur either formally or informally. Also, by addressing specific cognitive skills, you can add power to your style and strategies as you prepare for future challenges.</p>
                        <p>You report yourself as being slightly more conservative in your thinking style than the typical manager. While this style may help you pursue a safer approach, it may hinder you from staying in front of the competition. You may also hesitate to take risks, which are required to thrive in any business and management situation. Your more conservative thinking style may prevent you from envisioning all possible alternatives.</p>

                                <p>Read about creativity and innovation; specifically, read books that focus on developing personal creativity. It will be helpful to understand which situations are most amenable to creative thinking. It will also be beneficial to develop techniques, such as brainstorming, that you can use when working with others. Such techniques will allow you to break boundaries and champion change.

                <p class="instructions__intro">All information in this report is confidential and should be treated responsibly.</p>
                <p>This report is based on computerized comparisons between individual responses and the professional norm on the Watterson Personality Inventory. It is prone to various sources of error and should be interpreted with caution. This report is intended to assist in the interview process, not to substitute for it or for other data. The candidate's scores for each scale are discussed on individual pages.</p>
                <p>For each section on the following pages, you will find a GREY SHADED BOX. This box indicates the average score for a successful professional. A score within this range indicates that the candidate reports similarly on that dimension as compared to the successful professional.</p>
                <p><strong>CANDIDATE SCORE</strong> is represented by a graphic shown below:</p>
                <p><strong>HIGHER AND LOWER SCORES</strong> are deviations from the typical score of the profile of professionals in the report. If a candidate describes himself differently as compared to the typical profile, an explanation of the differences will appear in a separate statement. In addition, there will often be interview questions related to the difference to help the interviewer explore a particular area.
                <br><br>
                The graphic indicates a suggested confidence interval around the blue dot, which identifies the applicant’s exact score. The graphic is a reminder that variations in the measurement process can give more range to these scores than just the dot.</p>
                <p><strong>Target range scores</strong> are those where either a portion or the entire graphic (blue dot flanked by orange arrows) falls within the grey shaded area. Achieving a target range score can happen in two ways. To help explain, it is worth mentioning that each key dimension in consideration (Emotional Resilience, Interpersonal Style, etc.) is made up of four to five separate facets e.g. Emotional Resilience is composed of emotional stability, trust, apprehension, and tension.
                <br><br>
                Being in the target range can happen with moderately strong scores on all or most of these dimensions. A second way the target range can be reported is with a couple of very strong scores in the high direction and one low score, averaging out to be within the target range.</p>
