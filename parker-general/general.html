                        <p>Drive is related to the ability of the candidate to exhibit persuasive, assertive, and influential behaviors. This includes the ability to be bold and persuasive and to pursue answers to difficult challenges. Related to this measure is the courage and willingness to assume calculated risks to achieve desired results. There often is a certain amount of vigilance to assure desired objectives. This dimension assesses the drive to challenge others, resolve issues, and move with urgency for change and perceived progress. Many of these behaviors are not a core part of being a professional in a role with no direct reports; however, in certain roles, there is an advantage to have some of them. Determine which behaviors are critical and see how these fit with this score. Also, if this individual is seen as a future candidate for a management/leader role, look to have this score be a little higher than the average here.</p>

                    <div class="dimension__global-statement">
                        <p>His lower score on Drive indicates a tendency to be more accommodating to the boundaries of the company or to others, and it suggests that he is generally trusting, accommodating, and conservative in his approach. In team situations, he will often be a good participant, without particular interest in taking a leadership position. In situations that demand a strong stand for his position, his tendency is to be accommodating and agreeable, which can potentially work against him for some of his own interests. As a general style, if he has demonstrated success in the past, he may have relied on his general tendency to be hard working, organized, and precise (see Conscientiousness). He may also be well liked, and people may be quite comfortable with him. However, he may be taken advantage of in some situations. It may be a stretch for him to have influence, and he may have to push himself to initiate change by heightening his sense of urgency and working through organizational obstacles.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, specific scores make larger contributions or detractions to the management role. In regard to Drive here are areas to consider:</p>
                                <p>Modifying his score is his tendency to be accommodating. Managers typically report a higher interest in being in charge and in controlling business circumstances. He may use company processes or a disciplined approach to take control, versus being more personally assertive. This approach may be effective in a structured system; however, in more flexible and fluid business situations, it is important to exercise more personal authority</p>

He is comfortable with himself, and he generally takes responsibility for his actions. In many ways, his trust is a positive trait, but at the same time, it is important to be able to realistically anticipate and assess people and situations. It is helpful to be mindful of others’ agendas in a complex business environment, and it is important not to be naïve. His communication style can be very trusting and open, but he will also need to be able to be confrontational in certain situations.</p>

                                <p>He reports a slight tendency to exhibit some degree of concern when looking at the past or the future. He may also tend to doubt himself to a certain degree. It will be important to see if this tendency is part of his technique for driving himself to achieve. If so, his openness to his own limitations can be healthy, if monitored effectively. A certain amount of self- doubt can help him remain open to development. But, the self-doubt needs to be kept in check so that he is able to move forward with a sense of general acceptance and a self-assured style. As long as his drive does not unduly interfere with the level of confidence and self-assuredness necessary to communicate with and influence others, it can be controlled. It is important, however, to make sure that he has access to the skills to maintain this balance.</p>

                        <p>This dimension focuses on sensitivity to people and to ideas. It measures the willingness to be open to and to try new approaches. Balance on this dimension suggests responsiveness to how others feel and think while being practical, factual, and business-minded. Intuition can assist the candidate in “reading” others and responding appropriately to their needs. As with self-control, for the more detailed, task focus of typical professional or technical roles, intuition, creativity, sensitivity to others may well not be an important criterion to high performance. Thus, the target range is a little higher than for managers/leaders which typically is in the middle, more balanced.

Being overly tough can create callousness toward people, their feelings, and his own intuition; all can prove hazardous to his success.</p>

                                <p>A modifier to his score is his reported orientation to being open to change and receptive to new ideas. This posture is particularly helpful in management situations where rapid growth is needed. This trait may also help him be receptive to possibilities in development and design. Because he is more experimental and change oriented, he can push for results. While this orientation may be helpful in some circumstances, it may also create frustration for him when people or events do not move as quickly as he would like. At times, when things are not moving as quickly as he desires, he may be perceived as being critical or judgmental.</p>

                        <p>Scores on this scale represent the candidate's capacity to direct her energies towards goals and commitments. This measure is related to attendance and consistency of behavior. Execution is associated with timeliness, focus, organization skills, and attention to detail. This trait is also related to the candidate’s interest in following the procedures and the guidelines of the organization and one’s preferred style of operation (i.e. systematic and orderly or flexible and spontaneous). Execution is a measure of how planful the candidate is relative to meeting company and customer needs; does the person follow through?</p>

                        <p>His score on this dimension most likely represents a strong sense of conscientiousness and a self- disciplined approach to work. He follows through on his commitments and does so in a routine and procedural way. Although self-discipline is important, it is also advantageous to have some flexibility so that routines do not restrict his openness to new approaches or ideas. He tends to look for the expectations that are put in front of him and then disciplines himself to meet them. In a technical, highly process-oriented environment, it is important to pay attention to the disciplines and procedures that are in place. However, in situations that require strategizing or thinking about different alternatives, his style would be lacking.</p>

                                <p>He reports himself as generally being a person of high energy and enthusiasm. In general, this trait can be productive in business where there is frequent contact with people (e.g. sales and management). His enthusiasm can be infectious, and his energetic approach may have a positive impact on the teams or groups with which he works. However, his lively approach may distract him from staying on track. Talk to him about how he balances his enthusiasm with focus.</p>
