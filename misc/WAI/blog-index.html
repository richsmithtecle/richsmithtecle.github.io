				<h1>Assessment vs Evaluation</h1>
				<p>By David Watterson</p>
				<p>Many of us flinch when we hear that we are going to have an assessment done - on us. We most often interpret it as being an evaluation, and we are challenged with the awareness that we may come up short. At WAI, we are committed to at least having the discussion of clarifying the distinction of assessment vs evaluation. Without this, there is much needless confusion of purpose and outcome.</p>
				<p>When we assess an individual, we are simply collecting relevant information about a person&apos;s skills, abilities, personality, interests, etc. In essence, we are taking a personal inventory of these characteristics. Evaluation is then the assigning of a value to these dimensions in relationship to a goal, objective or outcome. None of these characteristics are positive or negative until you have declared your destination or purpose. Where are you going? What are you planning to do? Nothing is good or bad about a maple tree until you say what you are planning to do with it. Planting it in NE Ohio for shade purposes might be good, but in Arizona, not so much.</p>
