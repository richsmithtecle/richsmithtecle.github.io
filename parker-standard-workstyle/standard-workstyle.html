But in jobs that are highly team-oriented, he may not be as effective as required. Has he learned to compensate for his slightly introverted personality? If so, how does he do so? If not, is his more introverted style going to restrict his effectiveness?</p>

                            <p>He reports himself as being very calm, and highly confident; little upsets this person. If this is an accurate assessment, it suggests that he can effectively deal with the stress and pressure of a fast-paced and determined work environment. Yet, it may also suggest that he is less motivated to change, as he tends to be comfortable and unworried- perhaps he’s overly confident? During the interview, listen for the difference between being appropriately self-assured versus being too comfortable, perhaps lacking a sense of urgency and interest in continuous improvement. Is he cocky?</p>

His ability to take an independent stand and make decisions is where we would expect it to be. How well he is received by others will depend on his level of self-awareness regarding his interpersonal skills, as well as his capacity to monitor and regulate his drive and emotion. Listen for obstacles that have hindered progress. How does this compare to the expectations of Parker?</p>

His structured approach is so high that there is anticipated to be rigidity, inflexibility, or perfectionism negatively impacting his style. While there are aspects of his work approach that are productive in a technical environment, his highly systematic approach may diminish his ability to flexibly adjust to different courses of action and shifting needs.</p>
